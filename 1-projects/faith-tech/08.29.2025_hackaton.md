# if i go to hawwai not to do 
- Maybe one is an app, maybe one is a database. because not everyone is an app developer
- create a category of projects
- we should require the ministry partner to submit their ideas in advanced so we can bet the idea, so we can check agaisn't the skillset and work it will take to do the project 
- In the registration we can ask about the skillset so we can see how many apps or ideas we can tackle
- we need to have a form for project idea and a form for what are the skillset they have 

# potential sponsors?
- AWS may sponsor the one in Tampa
- Chick fill may sponsor to help with the food in the hackaton, maybe reach out to one of the owners
