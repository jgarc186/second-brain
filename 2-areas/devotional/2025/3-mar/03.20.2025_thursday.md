### Scripture:
20 Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I have done: 21 When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia,[c] two hundred shekels[d] of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels,[e] I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
(Joshua 7:20-21)

### Observation
One fo the things that I remeber about Rabbi Daniel Lapin is that he always says that we can't be lead by our eyes, but rather we should be lead by our minds.
The Lord has called us to be a people of the Book, meaning that we should be lead by our thinking rather than by what we see.

### Application
I will remember that I should be lead by my mind and not by my eyes. I will remember that I should be lead by the word of God and not by what I see.

### Prayer
Lord Jesus I pray that you may help me to be humble and to be guided by your word and truth rather than by what I see. Amen!
