# 03.31.2025 - The Power of Contemplation and Meditation

### Scripture:
My mouth will speak words of wisdom;
the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.
(Psalm 49:3)

### Observation:
Repetition is the mother of all learning, which makes it the father of action. That's what
Zig Zigglar used to say, and this verse reflects this truth. Contemplation and meditation gives
way for us to train our hearts and minds on God's wisdom. The power of reflection and constant
contemplation is the art of training the inner man to be able to discern the will of God in all
things.

### Application:
Just like this is applicatable to the study of the Bible, so it is also applicable to all areas of 
our lives. For example, with regards to programming the fact thart I can type at the aspeed that I'm 
typing noew required me to meditate on the keyboard and the keys, and the layout of the keyboard.
This contemplation and meditation is what has given me the ability to type at the speed that I'm typing
now. As I continue to meditate on the keyboard, I will continue to get better at typing. The same princniple
holds true to the study of of the Word of God.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus I pray that you may help me to be diligent in my meditation and contemplation of your word, so That
I may be able to discern your will in all things. Amen.
