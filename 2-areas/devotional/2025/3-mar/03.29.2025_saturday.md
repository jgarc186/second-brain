# 03.29.2025 - Picking technology to help God's children

### Scripture:
11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. 
12 So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.
(1 Corinthians 14:11-12 NIV)


### Observation:
When I think about this verse I think about programmers and the desire to pick the latest and the shines technology, because they
think they are going to get more money and opportunitties, which in some cases this is true. But the focus should not be on just leanring
tech for the sake of learning new tech. The point should be to be able to solve problems that our customers are eager to resolve so we can provide
value to them. This is also the same mindset that the apostle Paul was address to the Corinthian church.

### Application:
As I grow in my career and influence, I need to be able to learn to provide solutions to complex problems, focus on learning the technology 
that I will help me to solve the complex problems that the clients have for their edification, rather than just learning tech for the sake of learning tech.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus I pray that you may help me to focus on learning the technology that will help me to solve the complex problems that the clients have
so that I may bring praise and glory to your Holy name in the market place. Amen!
