# 03.25.2025 - Keep Your Eyes on the Main Focus 

### Scripture:
31 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. 
32 Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of Godâ€” 
33 even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
(1 Corinthians 10:31-33)

### Observation:
One of the things that I think of when I read these bible verses is about the importance of keeping ourselves in check
meaning that we are not here to serve ourselves but to serve others. This realization comes from 
spending time studying jews teachings with Rabbi Daniel Lapin, he has helped me to gain great understanding
of the moral obligation we have with serving others and not focusing on money, but the act of service
the money is just a by product of such activity.

### Application:
As I'm grapping up my time working with iEG I need to remember that my main focus is to serve others
and not money, money will take care of itself as I focus on my services to others.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to keep my eyes on serving your children and to be able
to do so with the right attitude. Help me to keep my eyes on the fact that I'm here to put a smile
on your face as your children praise you because of the good service I provided to them. Amen!
