### Scripture:
18 When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests. 
19 It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the Lord his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees 
20 and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
***Deuteronomy 17:18-20***

### Observation:
Rabbi Daniel Lapin always says when we don't have God in our lives, the ultimate law in our lives in us, which translates to others trying to regular and control our lives. 
When we have Got ad the center of our lives, we are able to get the higher level of accountability that we wouldn't be able to get by us been accountable only to ourselves.
This in turn will make us better leaders and people in general.
