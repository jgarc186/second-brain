# 06.02.2025 Training Myself

## Scripture:
6 Start children off on the way they should go,
    and even when they are old they will not turn from it.
Proverbs 22:6 (NIV)

## Observation:
Yesterday we were visiting a friend of my wife and her family. During our interaction with them they mentioned the concerned that they
have for their children. This family is Indian and it was nice and refreshing to see how they were just like my parents and like so many
other parents that we know here in the US. Even with the cultural differences, they were experiencing the same challenges that many other
parents in the US are facing. So it was nice to see that parenting transcends culture and geography.

## Application:
With that observation in mind, we now turn towards the bible verse that I extracted from Proverbs. As I was pondering over this verse,
I realize that I can apply this to my own life. I'm in a way my own parent, and I need to train myself in the way that I should go, so that
the future version of me will reap the benefits of the training that I give myself today.

## Prayer:
Dear Lord, thank you for the wisdom of your word.
Help me to train myself in the way that I should go, so that I can become the person you want me to be.
May I be diligent in my efforts and trust in your guidance as I navigate the challenges of life. Amen.
