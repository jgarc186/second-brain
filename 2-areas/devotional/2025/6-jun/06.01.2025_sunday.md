# 06.01.2025 - Doing Due Diligence

## Scripture:
2 Desire without knowledge is not goodâ€”
    how much more will hasty feet miss the way!
(**Proverbs** 19:2)

## Observation:
As a developer one of the things that I see a lot in our industry is that people love to invent new terms, for every new technology that comes along. This is the nature of the industry, complicated terms to try to express a simple concept, because they want to sound fancy and like experts. There is nothing wrong with this terms, but me been already 8 years in this field sometimes I COME ACCROss terms and specailly now with ML that I'm like, "who is inventing these names?"

## Application:
Anyways, thanks to chatbots we don't have to become experts at anything and thanks to chatbots the desire to do dillient research and try to comprehend complex things are down. this to me is an advantage for what I do since this will benefit my career and work, I wil put this proverb to practice and I will not be hasty in my feet, but I will take my time to do my due dilligence and to learn the things that I need to learn.

## Prayer:
Lord, I thank you for the wisdom that you give us through your word. I thank you because you are teaching me to be diligent and to take my time to learn and understand things. Help me to not be hasty in my feet, but to take the time to do my due diligence and to learn the things that I need to learn. Amen!
