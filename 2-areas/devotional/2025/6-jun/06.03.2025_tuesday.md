# 06.03.2025 - Death and My Eyes

## Scripture:
20 Death and Destruction[b] are never satisfied,
    and neither are human eyes.
(Proverbs 27:20)

## Observation:
This Bible verse must be in every marketers creative room, the human eyes are never fulfilled, and this is because we have infinity living inside us.
The ultimate source of life and expension is within each one of us, which is our souls. Our sould know what eternity is, and what it feels like, so 
as our souls are bound to this physical body, it tries to find what it knows is out there, but can't get enough of it, so it tries to replace that with 
physical things which do provide some level of spiritual fulfillment, but not enough to satisfy the soul.

## Application:
I have to be mindful of this reality, because marketers are out there trying to use this same reality to sell me things that I don't really need, but 
that I want. This is also true of tv shows, movies, porn, music, and youtube videos, they all play from the same playbook, counting on the fact that we 
all creave infinity and that we all want to be fulfilled, but the reality is that only God can fulfill us.

## Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to keep this knowledge right infront of my mind, help me to be aware and mindful that my eyes are like Death
which is never satified. Help me to use this reality to my advantage, by providing services to others that will help them to find fulfillment in you in what I do. Amen!
