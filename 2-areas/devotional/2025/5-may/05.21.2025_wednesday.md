# 05.21.2025 - Developing a Jews Heart

### Scripture:
28 A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. 
29 No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code.
Such a personâ€™s praise is not from other people, but from God.
(Romans 2: 28-29)

### Observation:
This is what I was refering to sometime ago to my wife's family, Jesus was a jew and christians by what we believe in we are also jews 
in the spirit. Not by our blood our geritage, but by the spirit, this again doesn't mean that we need to keep the law and everything in it.
No, but rather we should follow the spirit of the law, which is to love our Lord our God with all of our hearts, souls, and minds and to also
love our neighbors as ourselves.

### Application:
With this in mind, yes its good and profitable to study jews tradition and to understand the cutulre of the time to gain deeper context and messages
from our bible study times, but we must also keep in mind that we not only need to be hearers of the word, but also doers of it. Otherwise, we fall
under the same judgement of the pharaseries and scrives. They were very informed and study, but didn't put into practice what they knew.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to develop a heart that is full of gratitude and full of desire to please you in all of my ways. Amen!
