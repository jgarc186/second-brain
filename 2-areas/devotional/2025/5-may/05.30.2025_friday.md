# 05.30.2025 - The Hyper Feedback Loop

## Scripture:
12 Mockers resent correction,
    so they avoid the wise.
(Proverbs 15:12 NLT)

## Observation:
Why would the same behavior be practice by mockers and people who don't want to share their projects or things that they are working on? Why would mockers and people who don't want
to present fall on under the same trap? I understand that the mocker doesn't want feedback, because they are not intestedted in growing and changing their ways. I understand that
and I also understand that many people don't share or expose themselves out there for fear of rejection, criticism, or don't wanting to feel humiliated. I get that, so I would
assume that both the mocker and the person who doesn't want to share are avoiding, not the wise, but the same thing: feedback. The mocker avoids the wise because they know that 
they will be corrected, and the person who doesn't want to share avoids feedback because they are afraid of being corrected. In both cases, the avoidance of feedback leads to stagnation.

## Application:
As a developer I get lots and lots of feedback, I get feedback from other developers who review my code, I get feedback from the QA team who test my code, and I get feedback from
the users who use my code. I am in a hyper feedback loop, of constant iteration and improvement. Its designed this way in order to ensure product quality and user satisfaction.
It is part of the process, and I have become so accustomed to it that I don't even think about it anymore. But this practice of constant feedback and iteration is something that I 
can take also into my personal life. This constant practice is essential to creating deliver practice which leads to higher levels of mastery and pride in my own work and ownership of what I produce.
So for today, at work I will present what I have worked on this week and seek feedback from the team. I will expose myself to hearing back from others, just this morning I meet
with my doctor and he gave me some great feedback on my  health, and I will take it to heart and keep working on it.

## Prayer:
Dear Lord, thank you for the gift of feedback and the opportunity to grow through it. Help me to embrace correction and to seek wisdom from those around me. 
May I not shy away from sharing my work or my life, but instead be open to the insights and guidance of others.
Teach me to value the process of iteration and improvement, both in my professional and personal life. Amen.
