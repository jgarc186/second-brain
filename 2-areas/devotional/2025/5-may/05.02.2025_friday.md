# # 05.02.2025 Becoming a Faithful Steward

### Scripture:
Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be complete, fgo and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and yuou woi; have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
But when the young man heard thius statement he want away grieving; for he was one who owned much property.
And Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
(Matthew 19: 21-23)

### Observation:
One of the things that spoke to me today through this verse was how if i was there and asked jesus the same question, how would i have reacted?
The reality is that I would had probably reacted the same way as this young ruler. So the lesson in here for me is to be able to master my ability to 
surrender it all to the Lord God if He ever calls me to do so.

### Application:
I need to be open to hear Jesus' voice to lead me and guide me to all truth in my life. If I am able to listen to his voice and be guided by it,
this will help me to surrender to be able be a good steward of what God has given me.

### Prayer:
Father God, I pray that you will help me to be a good steward of what you have given me. I pray that you will help me to be open to your voice and to be guided by it. I pray that you will help me to surrender all to you, so that I may be a good witness for you. Amen.
