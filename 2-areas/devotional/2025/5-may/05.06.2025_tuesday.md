# 05.06.2025 - Tax collectors & prostitudes  

### Scripture:
32 For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, 
but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. 
And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.
(Matthew 21:32, NIV)

### Observation:
One of the things that is really interesting to see is how the tax collectors and the prostitudes were at the same level in the jews society of that time.
I wonder why would the tax collectors be put in the same level as a prostitudes for the jews communitties? 

### Application:
When I think about it, it could had been the fact that these tax collectors were just like prostitudes, they would sell their souls for whatever amount of money
they were able to get, no matter who was affected or not.Because of their love for money, they like prostitudes, woudl set aside their traditiomns and God to make
a living through dishonest gains and extonsion.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to be able to reach out to both the tax collectors and prostitudes of my time for your glory and honor. Amen!
