# 05.03.2025 Servant Leadership

### Scripture:
25 Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 
26 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 
27 and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— 
28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
(Matthew 20:25-28)

### Observation:
I'm enjoying the fruit of many years of planting and waiting for the harvest to come. Now that I'm here, I see the importance of being a servant leader.
It is thanks to Jesus' teachings and example, that I am aware and conscious of the importance of such practice.

### Application:
With this awareness in mind, I will be intentional about being a servant leader in both my personal and professional life.
In my own house, I will lead my wife and future children by example, and I will be a servant leader in my work environment.

### Prayer:
Father God, I pray that you will help me to be a servant leader in my life. I pray that you will give me the strength and courage to lead by example, and to serve others with love and compassion. Amen.
