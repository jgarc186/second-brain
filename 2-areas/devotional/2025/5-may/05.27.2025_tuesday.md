# 05.27.2025 Confidence in God's love

## Scripture:
31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us allâ€”how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? 
33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.
(Romans 8: 31-33)

## Observation:
This is a really good observation made by the apostle Paul, if God did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us, how much more will he give us all things?
This is hard to comprehend, but it is essential for us to grow and mature in our character of Christ, because the fact that our God didn't spare his own Son
reminds us that He will give us all things for those that call upon Him and trust in Christ Jesus.

## Application:
With this understanding, in our minds we need to come to Him with a humble and grateful heart, because the assuranve that we have in Christ is powerul and it also
builds our confidence, not in specualations or "magic words", but in substance, and in the power of truth.

## Prayer:
Dear Lord, thank you for not sparing your own Son, but giving Him up for us. Help me to always remember the depth of your love and the assurance that comes
from trusting in you. May I approach you with a humble and grateful heart, confident in the truth of your promises. Amen.
