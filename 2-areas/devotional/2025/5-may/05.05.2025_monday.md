# 05.05.2025 - Keeping my Mind in the Lord 

### Scripture:
Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.
(Psalm 20: 7-8)

### Observation:
This is a great reminder to put my trust in the Lord my God, and not in my own strength or resources.

### Application:
I will be intentional with keeping these two verses in mind.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to be mindful and aware of these two verses through the rest of this day.
Help me to keep my mind in You and in Your faithfulness. Amen!
