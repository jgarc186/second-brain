# 05.17.2025 - Becoming Kings

### Scripture:
10 Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. 
11 He had reigned forty years over Israelâ€”seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. 
12 So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.
(1 Kings 2: 10-12)

### Observation:
One of the great things that the Jews people have is that they have such great role models in their text,
look at king David, he started from nothing, tending sheep and he became the most powerful ruler of the
Kingdom of Israel.

### Application:
One of the things that I have learned in our time in Europe is the power of art and of ethos. The stories
that we allow ourselves to dwell on and ponder upon. Such stories helped shape us into the man that we are 
destined to be. When we do such thing, we are able to get inspiration and guidence in our ways and to be able
to achieve more than we could had done by ourselves.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to develop a mind that is able to see the unkown and to be able to walk in it 
just like king David did. He didn't know what his future hold, but as we see him progress through his life we see a man
who is able to transform himself into a powerful force to be able to subdue nature and bend it to do your perfect will on earth.
Help me to develop such character. Amen!
