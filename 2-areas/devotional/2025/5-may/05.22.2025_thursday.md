05.22.2025 - Developing a Humble Heart Before the Lord

### Scripture:
20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in Godâ€™s sight by the works of the law;
rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
(Romans 3: 20)

### Observation:
The first step to comming to terms with God's mercy for our lives is the awarenesss and concious of our behaviors
and to truly understand were all these things are comming from. Because when we do, we are able to recognize Jesus'
sacrifice on the cross and this realization helps us see that we need His saving grace, not by works or how
good we can be, but by mercy alone we are able to praise His name for His goodness in our lives.

### Application:
There is power in coming to terms and relizing that we are in need of a Savior, when we come to terms with such a 
reality we are able to develop a heart of gratitude and therefore a humble heart before God and others around us.

### Prayer:
