# # 05.18.2025 Skillful Hands & Integrity of Heart

### Scripture:
72 And David shepherded them with integrity of heart;
    with skillful hands he led them.
(Psalm 78:72, NIV)

### Observation:
Two things we notice in this verse, first is that David shepherded the people of God with integrity and the second is that he led them with skillful hands.
When we think about the word shepherd, we think about someone who is taking care of and defending the sheep. Also, when it comes to thinking about skillful hands,
we think about someone who is able to do things with excellence and with a high level of quality.

### Application:
I feel like I have a right heart, but I need to work on my skillful hands. I want to take my game to the next level, in both my personal and professional life.
Skill takes time to develop, it isn't something that happens overnight, it takes 10 thousand hours to become an expert in something, or so they say. So I need to be patient
and intentional about my ability to problem solve through algorithms and data structures, this is not only about remembering, it does help, but also about understanding the 
problem at hand, coming up with multiple solutions, dicussing them with others and then implementing the best solution based on the constraints of the problem.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to be able to develop my skillful hands and to be able to shepherd the people of God with integrity. Amen!
