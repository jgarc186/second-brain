# 05.07.2025 - The Abomination of Desolation

### Scripture;
15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 
16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
(Matthew 24: 15-16)

### Observation:
We can clearly see that Jesus was bringing not only wisdom into his disciples lives, but he was also bringing prophetic words to them that even in the future
the early christian church was able to see and actually flee to the mountains when the Romans came to destroy Jerusalem.

### Application:
When this prophecy was fullied, we see two historians (Josephus and Eusebius) that recorded the event of the destruction of Jerusalem, this makes me want to become a 
better student of this time and to see the unfolding of the early church and how serious they took Jesus' words.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to be able to see the unfolding of your words in my life and in the lives of those around me. Amen!
