### 03.30.2025 Learning to Speak Life to My soul 

### Scripture:
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why so disturbed within me?
Put your hope in God,
for I will yet praise him,
my Savior and my God.
(Psalm 42:11)

### Observation:
One of the things we can learn from the Psalmist is that we can speak to our souls, we can use words to encourage our souls.
We can speak life, energy, vitality, and courage to it. So, we are not bound to our present feelings and state of mind, but we can
alter and course correct them in order to bring them to submission to the will of Jesus Christ our Lord.

### Application:
Learning to encourage myself is an essential skill to be able to master my future and myself. This is something that I need to practice and keep improving at.

### Prayer:
Lord, help me to learn to speak life to my soul, to encourage myself, to be able to master my future for your glory. Amen.
