# Wednesday, March 12, 2025 - Spiritual Gravity

### Scripture:
22 But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, 
being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.
***Galatians 3:22***

### Observation:
Sin is spiritual gravity. It pulls us down and keeps us from reaching the heights that God has for us.
It is this same gravity that brings antrophy to what is good and noble in our lives. This is the reason
why things can't be static in our lives, they are either growing or dying. They are either moving forward or moving backwards.
The Jews know this, that is why they have the concept of the Shabbat, where they take a day off to rest and to reflect on their lives.
This is now given to us gentiles through faith in Jesus Christ. We are able to rest in Him and to reflect on our lives and to be able to move forward in Him.

### Application:
With Christ at the center of our lives, we are now able to examine our lives and to be able to move forward in Him.
By moving towards Him, we are able to fight against the spiritual gravity that is pulling us down.
We are able to fight against the sin that is trying to control our lives and to be able to move forward in Him.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to be able to move forward in you.
Help me to be able to fight against the spiritual gravity that is pulling me down.
So that you Holy name maybe glorified in my life. Amen!
