# 03.27.2025 - Learning to be a team player 

### Observation:
7 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. 
8 To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,
(1 Corinthians 12:7-8)

### Application:
Team work is all about collaborating and building with others a future that we alone will not be able to produce, but when i work with others and 
they first like to work with me and second they trust me that I will be able to deliver the goods, then we can be able to create something that 
we would had not been able to create on our own.

### Application:
As I have concluded my work with iEG, I saw first hand the importance of been able to work and collobrate with others with different skills and 
knowledge that I currenlty don't posses and will not be looking to posses. The ability to comminucate and share ideas with others is an important skill 
plus the ability to keep your word and to be able to follow through on your promises is what makes team work possible.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to become the leader and team player that you have called me to be, so that others may come and praise your holy name.
Help me to be able to put a big smile on your face by putting smiles on your children's faces. Amen!
