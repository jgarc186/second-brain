# 03.19.2025 Submissive to the Lord

### Scripture:
14 “Neither,” he replied, “but as commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.” Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, “What message does my Lord[e] have for his servant?”
(Joshua 5:14)

### Observation:
This is a reminder that even Joshua was under authority to the Lord. Even when he was the main leader, he still had to bow down to the Lord and ask for guidance. This is a reminder that even when we are in leadership positions we still have to bow down to the Lord and ask for guidance.

### Application:
I will remember that I'm not in control, God is. I'm just exectuing His desires in this earth.

### Prayer:
Father in Jesus name help me to be able to be submissive to your perfect will in this earth. Help me to be able to be a humble servant to your perfect will in this earth. Amen!
