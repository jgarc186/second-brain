# 04.07.2025 - Holiness, the Engine of Success

### Scripture:
Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
(2 Corinthians 7:1)

### Observation:
This verse reminds me of the concept that was talked about in the book "The Intellectual life", which is the idea of energy. When we use our energy for sinful habits
we are robbing ourselves from that energy that can potentially be use for the good of those around us. The author went on to explain why certain sins zaps energy from us, 
and how such energy once is concecreated can be use for the great benefit of the communinity since the intellectual can create and share great things with the world.

### Application:
Keeping these truths in mind is essential, since concecreation is the engine that can propel me to a life of meaning and of service to God's children in this world.
When I was growing up, I always thought that holiness was for our own good but now with more experience and knowledge under my belt I can see that holiness is a powerful
tool that can be use to create amazing and powerful things for the glory of God and for my own good and family.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I thank you because you spoke directly to my heart this afternoon. Thank you for revealing these things to me for your name and glory. Amen!
