# 04.22.2025 - Feeling grateful 

### Scripture:
Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogies and procliming the gospel of the kindom,
and healing every kind of disease and every kinf of sicjness. (Matthew 9:35)

### Observation:
This is what I was saying last time regarding Capernaum, and the sea of Galilee, meaning that powerful events and things
happen in this region to be able to have impacted history the way that Jesus did.

### Application:
Not much of an application today, just a simple reminder that of the significance of my visit to this region and how
privileged I am to have been able to see the places where Jesus walked and did miracles. Just a big sense of gratitude 
and wonder for what the Lord my God has done in my life.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus I thank you because you are using this time to refine my character and inner man in such a way that I am able to 
be more grateful and thankful for the things that you have given me. Amen!
