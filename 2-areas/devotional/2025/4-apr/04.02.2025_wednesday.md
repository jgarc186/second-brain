# 04.02.2025 - Satan's schemes

### Scripture:
10 Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,
11 in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
(2 Corinthians 2:8-11)

### Observation:
One of the things that I need to improve upon is becoming aware of Satan's schemes, this is not too complicated, people make it
seem like its takes a rocket science to understand the devil's schemes, but it's not. It's just a matter of being aware of them
here are some examples: 
- Sexual immorality
- Impurity
- Debauchery
- Idolatry
- Witchcraft
- Hatred
- Discord
- Jealousy
- Fits of anger
- Rivalries
- Dissensions
- Divisions
- Envy
- Drunkenness
- Orgies

### Application:
Those this list looks familiar? It's because it's the list of the fruits of the flesh, and the fruits of the spirit are the opposite of this list.
So, the more I'm aware of the fruits of the flesh, the more I'm able to discern the fruits of the spirit. The more I'm able to discern the fruits of the spirit, the more I'm able to walk in the spirit and not in the flesh.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus help me to stored this list in my mind so I can recall it as quickly as possible so I can act on the knowdlege of your word
rather than acting ourt of my flesh. Amen!
