### Scripture:
Now Naomi had a relative on her husbandâ€™s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz.
(Ruth 2:1)

### Observation:
As a man one of the things we must master is the ability of becoming, women are already, but with man we must become.
As we see the story of Boaz he was a man who already had standing, recognition, he was an elder of his town, he was known
by his people as a man of influence and stature. This is the same model we must follow when building ourselves as men, we must become man
of stature and of influence.

### Application:
The Bible gives us so many great examples of men who become influential and powerful on their own right, Joseph became the second in command of Egypt,
Daniel was a prophet to the king of Babylon, Moses spoke to Pharoah as an embassador of the living God. With all these great witnesses we can learn to grow
and mature like all these men of old and transform ourselves into men of influence and stature.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus I pray that you may help me to be able to be humble and to listen to your word in all that I do and say, help me to be a man of integrity and
of honor in all that I say and do. Help me to honor your with my gifts and talents and that all may get to see You in me and in all that I do and say. Amen!
