# 04.13.2025 - Testing Ourselves

### Scripture:
5 Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.
Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in youâ€”unless, of course, you fail the test? 
(2 Corinthians 13:5)

### Observation:
Taking the time to examine ourselves is an essential tool for us to be able to personally grow and mature into the 
people that God has called us to be. It may not be easy, but this helps to get a clearer picture of where we are in 
our spiritual journey with Christ.

### Application:
Taking the time to seat down and reflect on God and His goodness is a powerful tool to be able to observe
and see where we are at the moment. Can I see God working in my life? Can I see evidence of personal and spiritual growth?
Am I able to see the fruit of the spirit in my life? There are essential questions that we need to ask ourselves on a regular basis.

### Prayer:
Father I pray that I may be able to take the time to examine myself and see where I am at in my spiritual journey.
Help me to see the areas that I need to work on and the areas that I need to grow in. I pray that I may be able to see your goodness
in all the days of my life. Amen.
