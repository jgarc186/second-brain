# 04.16.2025 - Working through Me and In Me

### Scripture:
13 So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. 
14 In everything he did he had great success, because the Lord was with him. 
15 When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. 
16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.
(1 Samuel 18:13-16 NIV)

### Observation:
One of the things that I need to learn is the fact that the Lord is with me and if he is with me, He will guide me to victory from all of my enemies.
If He is with me, who can be against me? If He is going before me, why should I fear? I know that He is guiding my steps and my ways.

### Application:
As I potentially I'm about to embark in a new adventure, I need to remember that He is the Lord and that He is with in every step that I take.
I need to remember that He is the one who is guiding my paths and that my soul trusts in Him.

### Prayer:
Father God, I pray that you help me see how you are working in my life. I thank you because it is through you and your wisdom that I have overcome
pornography and lust. Thank you because I know that you are for me and that you are working through me. Amen!
