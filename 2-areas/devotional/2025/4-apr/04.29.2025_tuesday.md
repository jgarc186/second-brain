# 04.29.2025 - Trusting in the Lord

### Scripture:
8 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, “You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? 
9 Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 
(Matthew 16:8-9)

### Observation:
This is so interesting, because yesterday I read about the miracle of feeding the 5000, and just today in the next chapter we see
how the disciples were worried about not having bread. This is such a human condition, that I personally experience all the time.
For example, this morning I was worried about some money that a client owes me, but they have a good track record of paying me.
Maybe not as fast as I would personally like, but they always pay me. So this morning I was worried about that, and how we are going
to pay the upcoming obligations.

### Application:
This is a good reminder that I need to trust in the Lord and not relay on my own human strength.
I need to remember that if Jesus made a miracle with 5 loaves and 2 fish, he can do the same with my finances.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to understand this reality. That I'm not alone and that you are here with me 
fighting my battles. That I don't have to be afraid because the author of my future is holding me in his hands. Amen!
