# 04.27.2025 - Spending time alone with God

### Scripture:
22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. 
23 After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone,
(Matthew 14:22-23)

### Observation:
Jesus needed time alone with His Father, He saw this time as crucial to his ministry and destiny. One of the intersting things is to wonder what was Jesus
doing in such times, if we take an example of the mount of olives we can see that Jesus was praying and asking for strength to do the will of the Father.

### Application:
I need to remember that I need to take time alone with God, and that I need to pray and ask for strength to do the will of the Father. I need to make this a priority in my life, and I need to be intentional about it.

### Prayer:
Father God, I pray that you will help me to take time alone with you. I pray that you will help me to be intentional about my prayer life, and that you will give me the strength to do your will. Amen.
