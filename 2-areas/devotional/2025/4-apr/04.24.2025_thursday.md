# # 04.24.2025 Witnessing to Others

### Scripture:
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.[e] For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. 24 But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.‚Äù
- Matthew 11:23-24

### Observation:
Jesus spend a lot of his time in Capernaum, and even till this day we can witness the remains of the city and of Peter's house (which served as Jesus' headquarters).
Even with that and all the miracles that Jesus performed, the people of Capernaum did not repent.

### Application:
One can say "If I can be more persuasive more people will repent", but the truth is that the people of Capernaum had all the evidence they needed to repent and they still did not.
Human nature is such that we are not persuaded by evidence, but only by the Holy Spirit. I need to keep this in my mind as I witness and share the gospel with others.

### Prayer:
Father God, I pray that you will help me to be a good witness for you. I pray that you will give me the words to say and the courage to say them. I pray that you will open the hearts of those I witness to, so that they may receive your message of love and grace. Amen.
