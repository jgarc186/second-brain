# 04.26.2025 - Gratitude for the opportunity to see the place where Jesus walked 

### Scripture:
But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear. For truly I say to you that many propgets and righteous men desired to see what you see,
and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. (Matthew 13:16-17)

### Observation:
As we see Jesus in his hometown of Capernaum, we see that most of his teachings really took place there in the House, which I would consider it to be peter's house.
But who knows the gospels are not clear, the important thing is to think that Jesus was in Capernaum and how his terachings impacted the area and the people of his time.

### Application:
One of the things that I'm still in wonder is how I was able to see the place were all these things took place, and how I was able to walked where Jesus walked.
Its such a big privilage and honor to be able to do the things tat I have been able to do in my short life, and I'm so grateful to God for that.

### Prayer:
Father God, I thank you for the opportunity to see the place where Jesus walked and taught. I pray that you will continue to bless me and my family, and that you will help us to be a blessing to others. Amen.
