### Scripture:
18 And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate[a] the Lordâ€™s glory,
are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory,
which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
(2 Corinthians 3:18)

### Observation:
The veiled served as the barrier between us and God's glory, now that the veiled has been lifted now we can have access to his glory 
and we can use the art of contemplation in  order to transformed ourselves into a reflection of Him in this earth for Christ glory.

### Application:
Taking the time to just deeply ponder and reflect on God's goodness, laws, and mercies is a skill that help us to develop the ability to deeply 
contemplate and meditate on the things of God in this earth. This ability to just deeply ponder and focus on His goodness is what develops in us
His character traits and this in turns helps us to become more and more like Him in all the areas of our lives.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus I pray that you may help me to develop the skill of deep contemplation and meditation on your word, help me to always try to reflect 
your character and will in all the areas of my life. Amen.
