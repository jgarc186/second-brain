# 04.30.2025 - The Realities of Jesus' Ministry

### Scripture:
24 After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, 
“Doesn’t your teacher pay the temple tax?”
25 “Yes, he does,” he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak.
“What do you think, Simon?” he asked. “From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes—from their own children or from others?”
(Matthew 17:24-25)

### Observation:
Man there are so many reference to Capernaum in the Gospel of Matthew is like if the person who wrote this book was from there.
It also shows me that this house, was the headquarters of Jesus' ministry. The more I read this and the more I meditate on my trip 
to Israel, the more I realize that the house that the Bible refers to is the house of Peter, and it would make sense why this would was made into a church in the 4th century.

### Application:
After spending some time in reflection and talking with chatgpt, I have come to the conclusion of two main points:
- 1. Jesus ministry was very localized, but it was really profound and life changing for the dispicles they truly experienced something that changed their lives.
- 2. Because of this radical encounter and the mandate they got from the raisen Savior, they took the message throughout the world.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I thank you for correcting my mindset and understanding of how the world really works. Amen!
