# 04.21.2025 - Authority

### Scripture:
For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!'
and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it. (Matthew 8: 9)

### Observation:
The word authority is a word that unfortunately in our society has a negative connotation. People think that it is something like handmates tales or the patriarchy.
But in reality authority is all around us, if there wasn't a structure and authority figures society would collapse as a whole.

### Application:
As Christ followers we have an "unfair" advantage, because our scripture tells us to be under authority, to be submisive to our leaders and authority figures.
Because of this we are able to develop our faith muscles just like this centurion was able to do, this ordinary man didn't spend anytime studying the scriptures or praying.
But he did spend time been under and excersising authority, so when he saw Jesus' authority he was able to recognize it and understand it. Because of this simple understanding
of how authority works, he was able to stretch his faith and ask Jesus to heal his servant.

### Prayer:
Father in Jesus name I pray that you may help me to be under authority and to be submissive to my leaders and authority figures. Help me to be under your authority
and to be lead by your spritit in all of my ways. Amen!
