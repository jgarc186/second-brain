# 04.08.2025 - Meditation, Reflection, and Mindfulness

### Scripture:
11 I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
    yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
12 I will consider all your works
    and meditate on all your mighty deeds.‚Äù
(Psalm 77:11-12)

### Observation:
These are powerful verses, nowadays we all the buzz is about meditation and mindfulness. But we as Christians forget that meditation is just simply the ability
to think about something over and over again. Is to be so present with a thought or and idea that we get lost in it. The end result is that our brains become
so good at thinking about that which we have fixed our minds that it becomes easy to go back to it again and again even when we are not thinking about it.   

### Application:
Meditation is a powerful tool that we as believers have at our disposal. We can santify our thoughts and our minds with it and like we talked yestreday a 
santify life is a life that is full of energy to be able to serve others and bring glory and honor to God in the process.

### Prayer:
Father I thank you for reminding me of the importance of meditation and the power of mindfulness. Thank you for giving me all these powerful tools of transformation
and change. I pray that I may be able to use them on a regular basis so that I may reflect your nature in all that I do and say. Amen.
