# 04.25.2025 - Spiritual vs Human Family 

### Scripture:
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother." 
(Matthew 12: 50)

### Observation:
This is an interesting commundrum, in the one hand we have the biological family of Jesus, whom were truly concerned about him, and how he was behaving.
On the other hand, we have Jesus' disciples, who were believers and followers of Jesus. They both shared the same love for Jesus, but one group was the man
the other group saw Jesus as the Messiah.

### Application:
I need to remember that my family is not just the people I am related to by blood, but also the people I am related to by faith. I need to treat my family with love and respect, and I need to be a good example of what it means to be a follower of Jesus.

### Prayer:
Father God, I pray that you will help me to be a good example of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. I pray that you will help me to love and respect my family, and to treat them with kindness and compassion. Amen.
