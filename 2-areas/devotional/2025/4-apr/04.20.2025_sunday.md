# 04.20.2025 - Conquering New Enemies

### Scripture:
You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will clearly
to take the speck out of your brother's eye. (Matthew 7: 5)

### Observation:
One of the things that I see in my life now that I'm overcoming lust and porn
is that I'm more aware of other areas of my life that I need to work on. For example,
I have noticed that when I'm under pressure I tend to lie to others so that I can scape
that feeling of pressure. I have also noticed that I want to gossip and be critical of
others. These are areas that, interesting enough I never thought that I had a problem with
but now I'm more are of them.

### Application:
With that said, I wonder if the addiction to porn and lust trained me to scape from
feeling pressure by releasing early so that I can feel good and don't have to deal with
feelings of disconfor and pain.

### Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I thank you because you are showing me new areas of personal grwoth and
imporvement that I need to address and grow in. Thank you because !by deafeting the enemy
of lust I can clearly see other enemies that I need to defeat. Amen
