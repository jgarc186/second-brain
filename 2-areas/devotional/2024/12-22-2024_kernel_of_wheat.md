12.22.2024 Kernel of Wheat

**Scripture:**
23 Jesus replied, â€œThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 
24 Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. 
25 Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
(John 12: 23-25)

**Observation:**
Talent is great and developing knowledge is powerful, but in addition to be able to impact the world, we must be willing to die to self.
Why? Because when we die to self, we are able to produce many seeds, and we are able to impact the world in a greater way. For you see, we only have one life to live,
but when we die to self, we are able to produce many seeds, meaning we are able to impact other people's lives in a greater way and they in turn are able to impact other people's lives in a greater way.

**Application:**
Lying down my life and imparting my knowledge and being generous with others is essential to be able to plant as many seeds as possible.
This is one of the things that people don't realize, that when you die to self, you are able to impact the world in a greater way, because you are able to produce many seeds.
For this I must be willing to die to self, and be generous with my knowledge and my time.

**Prayer:**
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to be able to die to self, and be generous with my knowledge and my time. Amen!
