12-20-2024 Glory

**Scripture:**
37 On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. 38 Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.”[c] 39 By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
(John 7: 37-39)

**Observation:**
One of the things that we must come to understand is that there is potential for misunderstanding of scripture if we don't fully grasp the context of the things that were said and which times those things were said. This is the reason why I appreciate the gospel of JOhn, becuase he trys to give you the context of Jesus teacings, helping you to become aware of certain things that as a reader one could not possibliy know.

**Application:**
Becomeing aware and gaining more awareness of the world and the context of the things we are reading it helps to gain greater and deeper understanding. 

**Prayer:**
Lord Jesus, I pray that you may help me to be able to treasure every moment of life. Amen!
