12.21.2024 Good Shepherd

Scripture:
11 â€œI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 
12 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. 
13 The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. 
(John 10: 11-13)

Observation:
Ownership is a big deal, when you own something you are willing to take care of and protected it. while you just rent it isn't yours and you don't pay too much attention to it.
We can see this clearly from this verse, where the hired hand doesn't care for the sheep, because they are not his own. But the good shepherd does care for the sheep, because they are his own.

Application:
I mus t develop a good shepperd mentality, where I care for the things that are mine, and I am willing to lay down my life for them. Just like Jesus did for us.
Learning to develop this mentality is essential to safeguard and protect the things that are important to us.

Prayer:
Lord Jesus, I thank you for the example of the good shepherd, help me to develop the mentality of the good shepherd, where I am willing to lay down my life for the things that are important to me. Amen!
