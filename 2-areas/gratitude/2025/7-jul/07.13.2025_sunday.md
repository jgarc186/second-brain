# 07.13.2025 Gratitude Journal

1. Thank you Father God because you are teaching me to take my BUJO practice to the next level with capturing daily reflections
to be able to look back at the end of the week, and later at the end of the month, and year. Which will help me to gain insight and wisdom
on how to improve my life and take it to the next level. That is really powerful.
2. thank you Father because you have put a hedge of protection around me and my family, and I can see it in my day to day life.
3. Thank you because even when i fall, i can get back up again and keep growing and learning from my mistakes.
4. Thank you Father because you are teaching me to be still and know that you are God, that I don't have to chase after more things.
5. thank you you Lord Jesus because you are helping me to see that growth isn't a sprint, but a marathon, with multiple seasons and that
up hills and down hills are part of the process of learning and growing in my life.
