2. With that said, I thank you for giving me the time, tools, and patience to be able to learn and grow with Arch Linux.
3. Thank you Lord Jesus for Rabbi Daniel Lapin and his life, he is such a great teacher and blessing to me and my family.
4. Thank You Lord Jesus because I was able to control my anger during the last few days as I deal with Oreo.
5. Thank You Lord Jesus because my hand is healing properly and I am so happy that in a few days from now it will be fully recovered.
