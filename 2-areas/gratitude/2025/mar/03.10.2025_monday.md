- 1. Lord Jesus I thank you for helping me and giving me the hunger to grow and to develop into the type
of person that I'm.

to be able to mature and develop into the man that you have called me to be and that I'm able to express
and show the things that you have put within me.
- 3. Thank you Lord Jesus because I get this time to be able to reflect and think about the awesome things
that you are doing in me and through me.
- 4. Thank you Lord God for the ability to show and demostrate the knowledge that I have as a programmer
and that I'm not here to just talk the talk but to be able to walk the talk.

are in all that I do.
