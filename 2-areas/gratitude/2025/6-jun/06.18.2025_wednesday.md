# 06.18.2025 Gratitude Journal

1. Thank you Lord Jesus because yesterday night we had a very hard and difficult confrontation with my wife, we talked things out and it was
hard but I feel like we both were fair with each other even when we were both angry. Thank you because it is through these hard moments of conflict
that we are able to learn and more towards each other rather than letting us break apart. Thank you for the difficult and hard moments.
2. Thank you Lord Jesus because I was able to wake up early today, that means that I had a good night sleep and I woke up rested this morning.
3. Thank you Lord Jesus because I know that you are helping me to develop an owner's mindset.
4. Thank you Lord Jesus becuase I get the amazing privilege to be part of FaithTech and to be able to share and work with so many talented people.
5. Thank you Lord Jesus because you have given us the financial strength to be able to withstand the current economic turbulence that ThinkIQ is going through at the moment.
