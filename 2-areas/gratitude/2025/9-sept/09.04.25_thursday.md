# 09.04.2025 Gratitude Journal

1. Thank you Father God, because I was furlough and not fired or layoff from ThinkIQ.
2. Thank you Lord Jesus because I know in the inside of me that I did my best work for ThinkIQ and I'm proud of it.
3. Thank you Lord Jesus because I can keep my head on high and know that If I was furlough with Michael, I am a very important and special
person to Doug and Rob.
4. Thank you Lord Jesus because the time at ThinkIQ helped me to grow and develop my developer skillsets to the next level and my mindset too.
5. Thank you Lord Jesus because I don't know what my future is going to look like, but I know that you are the one who holds my future
and I know that the plans that you have for me are for good and not for evil. Plans to prosper me and not to harm me, to give me a hope and a future.
6. Also, thank you because considering my situation, I am in a very strong position as opposed to last year when something like this happen.
