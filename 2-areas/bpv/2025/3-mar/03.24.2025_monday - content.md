### Event:
At dinner my wife got mad at me because I didn't remember that she doesn't like musless.

### Feeling:
- Anger because I felt that she was overreacting.
- Unnapreciated because I felt that she didn't see the effort that I put the last couple of days.
- Judge and critized because I felt that she was judging me for not remembering something that I should have remembered.

### Re-Frame:
- I can see that my wife was hurt because I didn't remember that she doesn't like musless, I can see that she was hurt because she felt that I didn't care about her.
- I can see that when i don't remember things that she had said in the past about her preferences she feels that I don't care about her and I don't know her.
- She in turn may feel like I don't value her and that I'm taking her for granted.
- When she shares these things with me rather than overreacting I should listen more and try to put myself in her shoes and see things from her eyes.
