# 04.08.2025 - BPV# 1

### Event:
- My wife called me during her lunch break to tell me how she was feeling, during this time she told me that I wasn't supporting her.

### Feelings:
- Anger
- Misunderstood

### Re-Interpretation:
- I'm the master of the feedback loops, everytime I give in into my anger, I'm reacting to the feedback loop rather than creating a new one that drives the conversation forward.
- Arguments are essential to grow together and to be able to understand each other, arguments are not bad, they are a sign of growth and maturity.
- She may feel that you are not understanding her, this is an invitation to grow together and to be able to understand each other.
- This is a great opportunitty to practice my frameworks and see were are the spots in my BPV.
