# Week 32: Breaking Habits

Breaking even one bad habit is far harder than running a marathon
and far more vital to success in both romance and money.

### Weekly Waypoint

Focus on one bad habit that damages your relationships with others.
Do you often keep people waiting when you're made a time to meet,
neglect to ask about events in other people's lives, 
borrow small amounts of money without paying it back immediately...?
Set up a system to ensure that these things do not happen anymore.
