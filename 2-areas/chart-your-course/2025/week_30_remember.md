# Week Thirty: Remember

being grateful in the moment is important.
It is also important to remind yourself that you are
where you are thanks to those in your past.

### Weekly Waypoint
Each day write down the name of someone who supported or helped you in the past.
Call or write to thank as many people as you can who helped you become who you are.
