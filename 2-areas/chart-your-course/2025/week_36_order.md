# Week 36: Order

We humans do better when we convert the natural to the ordered.

### Weekly Waypoint
Pinpoint one area in your life that would benefit from more order. This might
be anything ranging from a messy desk to  sloppy way of planning your day.
Write it doen and each day take a baby step to improve that area.

### Video notes:
- God build a world that was in chaos, and then brought order to it.
- We do better as humans when we live an ordered life.
- When we plan our days and weeks, rather than letting it flow where it may go.
- When we have a clear desk, table, its better for us to human.
- God wants us to stand up to nature, to overcome our own human nature.
- Nature is disordered, gardens turn into jungles if you don't take care of it.
- That's the spiritual gravety that we all have to fight.
