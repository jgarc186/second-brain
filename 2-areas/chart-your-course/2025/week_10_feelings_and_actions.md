# Week Ten - Feelings and Actions

Our feelings follow our actions even more than our actions follow our feelings.

### Weekly Waypoint

- If someone in your life regularly irritates you, behave towards them the way you would if they were a cherished friend.
Keep track of any differences in your feelings towards them.

- **Action**: since i been standing more and more for my work i feel more energized and focused. I feel less tempted and able to master my own impulses.

### 03.09.2025 - SUNDAY

- Nothing to report for today or yesterday.

### 03.10.2025 - MONDAY

- This afternoon Ezequiel sent me over some silly question, or what I feel is just silly question. But
rather than responding to him in a negative tone i responded to him in a neautral tone with just facts and data.
I will be more mindful next time this happens.
