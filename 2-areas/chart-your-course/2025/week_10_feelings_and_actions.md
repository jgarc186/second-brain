# Week Ten - Feelings and Actions

Our feelings follow our actions even more than our actions follow our feelings.

### Weekly Waypoint

- If someone in your life regularly irritates you, behave towards them the way you would if they were a cherished friend.
Keep track of any differences in your feelings towards them.

### 03.10.2025 - MONDAY

- This afternoon Ezequiel sent me over some silly question, or what I feel is just silly question. But
rather than responding to him in a negative tone i responded to him in a neautral tone with just facts and data.
I will be more mindful next time this happens.

### 03.12.2025 - WEDNESDAY

- This afternoon I was thinking about Saketh and I decided to go and try to give him as a recommendation to the team at ThinkIQ.
Then he started to ask me all these random questions and I was bout to get irrited but I decided to treat him like he was a really good friend
and my feelings towards him changed. I was able to see him in a different light. So because of this I was able to give him a good recommendation.
