# Week 35: Accept the Challenge
People are not born great. Greatness comes as individuals respond to circumstances in their lives.

### WEEKLY WAYPOINT:

Take hold of a circumstance in your life that is hobbling you and change your 
attitude to accepting the challenge it presents and rising above it.

- start with something that is doable, start with something small that you can improve on.
- Then you can build on those small wins.
- its the little things that we want to accept those challenges.
- You don't have to start with the hardest thing, you can start with the small wins.
- When you are face with a challange you want to start with the small wins, then gradually go to the harder and harder parts.
