# Chapter 23: Go Beneath the Surface

If you are raising flowers or sheep, then the coloring, shape and other featuers
matter a great deal. With people, the external parts are of less importance than the person's 
character and soul. Unless you are screening someone for a job as a 
fashion model, focus on what is inside them.

### Weekly waypoint:
Discipline yourself not to jump to conclusions about people based on how they look.
Dig deeper and see what's beneath the surface.
