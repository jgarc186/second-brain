# Week 21: God is in Control

Knowing that God is in control may initially lead to anger and struggling with Him, but overall, it is comforting thought.
While the reason for suffering may be beyond our comprehension, there is a reason understood by one greater than us when things don't 
go as we hoped and prayed they would.

### Weekly Waypoint:
Accept the idea that we must exert effort in our lives, but God is in control of the outcome.
