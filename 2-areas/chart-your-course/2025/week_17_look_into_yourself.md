#  Week Seventeen: Look Into Yourself

Frequently what disturbs us about another person is that we recognize in him or her
a trait that we don't like in ourselves.

### Weekly Waypoint
If there is someone who truly gets on your nerves, spend a few moments each day
writing down what it is exactly that most annoys you. Looking into yourself (and if
you're very brave, ask someone) to see if you share some of that trait.

    - When I see other young men not having or valuing their relationship with their dads, that anoys me a lot.
    The reason why this is because I personally don't reach out to my dad and praise his efforts and great qualities that he has.
    With that said, I reached out to my dad today and had a great conversation with him. So this awareness of my own shortcomings helped
    me to take action and to reach out to my dad. I will keep this secret in my mind, since this is something I can use to keep improving in my life.
