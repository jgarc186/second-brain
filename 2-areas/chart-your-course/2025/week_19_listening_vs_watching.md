# Week Nineteen - Listening vs. Watching

The dark secret of visual technology is that it stifles imagination. The more you
watch, the less capable you become of filling hours without it.

### Weekly Waypoint:

Keep a log of  how often you check email and how uch electronic entertainment you
use or watch. cut that time in half and replace it with face-to-face time with ohters
or with reading or doing an activity.

### Sunday:
- Use my maps to keep track of were we were during our trip.
- Use my computer to keep track of my habits.
- Watched a couple of youtube videos regarding whoop 5.0.
- Read about 4-5 articles, three from jews wisdom and two of general news.
