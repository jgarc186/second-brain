- Dealing with OPC UA Nodesets has been a big challange, but the whole process has helped me to become more confident
and competent craftsman. It has been a journey of doubt and experimentation, but it has paid off big time.

- Yes today working through some freelance project, the level of mistrust and doubt that came from the client was a big challange.
But I said to myself this is the momennt to shine and to deliver under pressure. Sure it may not be confortable but i know that this 
an opportunity to grow and to become a better person. This is an opportunity to gain more of their trust so that we can develop a better relationship
and that we can work together in the future.
