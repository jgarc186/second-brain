# Week 38: Improve speaking skills

to succeed in business, you need to have something of value to offer. However, you also need to be able to 
let others know of your assets.

### Weekly waypoint:

Improve your speaking skills. Read aloud for 20 minutes each day. Pay attention to your tone
and pitch. Some days choose worthwhile script like a speech of Abraham lincoln or Winston
Churchcill. Other ways choose a read-alloud book meant for preschoolers and practice different
voices and expressing emotioon (bonus points for reaching to a preschooler.)

### Notes:

- This isn't only in business, but in all parts of our lives we need our ability to speak.
- Our mouth is what help us to connect with others.
- When your own ears hear your own words, this help us to improve our speaking ability.
- We need to train ourselves to love speaking angagement and sales presenations.
- Learn to speak without using clotch words "ummm...", "so", and "you know"
- People hire base on the fact that they would like to say "This person is part of our company"
for this reason alone, learning how to speak on your feed becomes essential when looking for work.
