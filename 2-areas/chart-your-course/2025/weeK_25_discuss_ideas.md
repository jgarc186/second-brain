# Week 25: Discuss Ideas

The worst conversations rovlve around people. Better conversations highlight things. The best conversations are when we discuss ideas.

### Weekly waypoint:
Keep track of how many times a day you engage in (speaking or listening to) gossip. Make a point of having an idea to discuss each time you
meet up with another person.
