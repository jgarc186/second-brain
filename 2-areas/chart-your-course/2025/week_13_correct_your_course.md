even when those things seem to be small and insignificant, they are not, they are the building blocks of a life of order and discipline.

- Being intentional with my words and what I commit too. While working on the iEG project, I noticed that I used a lot of words 
that I didn't intention to deliver, I took it lightly. Now that doesn't mean that I did not deliver, I did. but If I could go back in time
I would have been more intentional with my words and what I commit too, since I felt the pressure to deliver on my words, this has helped me 
to put an extra hour here or there to get what I said I was going to do, to get it done.
