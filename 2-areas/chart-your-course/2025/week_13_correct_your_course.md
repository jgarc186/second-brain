# Week thirteen-Correct Your Course

Veering off a sailing course by only one or two degrees may seem like a small matter, but over
the course of weeks the error accumulates and will cause you to miss landfall.

### Weekly Waypoint
Pay attention to the small details, Where can you correct course a degree or two in the right
direction?

- My spelling and grammar have been very sloppy, I need to pay more attention to the details of it,
in this way I can become a more precise communicator.

### 03.30.2025 - Sunday
- Developing the identity of a clean person, rather than letting things slide to clutter and disarray, such as unwashed dishes or disorganize bed,
even when those things seem to be small and insignificant, they are not, they are the building blocks of a life of order and discipline.
So I will be intentional about cleaning up after myself and keeping things in order.
