# Chapter 3: The Buffet Call Option

- "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatienet to the patient." - Warren Buffet pg 71
- Most people say they want a passive income strategy, but when they get one, it drives them crazy because it's boring. - pg 77
- If you were programmer with a working-class mentality, passive income could drive you crazy because you habe been told that you must work 
hard for your moeny. Making easy money feels wird at first. However, you learn to get used to it; over time, it will become hard to return
to the old way of doing things. pg 77
- I do not try to time the market. pg 80
- **Step 1:** I would invest 20% of my account (10% if I'm being conservative) into the longest-dated December SPY or SPX call option I could buy.
It's usually about two to three years out in time. pg 80
- I pick the most extended time frame because it gives me plenty of time to ride through any marktet corrections that my happen. pg 80
- **Step 2:** I leave the rest of my account in cash, uninvested. pg 80
- You leave most of your account in cash because you WILL one day lose 100% og your investement in those calls. When that happens,
you deploy another 20%. pg 81
- Another approach I often take is to sell my call once it has reached 100% profit. pg 84
- What if the markte crashed like it did in 2007-2009 and took about six years to receover? We usually buy tree-year call options, but even
those could not survive that crash. you'd lose 100% of the money invested int those calls if that ahppened. A 100% of the money
invested in those calls if that happened. A 100% loss is a reality every options investor needs to be prepared for. pg 85
- this is a simple trade you place once a year. pg 86
- start where you are and add more money to your account each yuear. As of this writing, the average LEAP call I buy cost between $2,000-$4,000.
there is on wealth without savings, so you can get into the game once you've saved taht amount. pg 88
- I usually buy my calls in Devember because more LEAP options are added around that time. pg 88
- **the BEST time to buy these LEAP call is during markte crashes, which is also the best time to buy broad-based index funds like SPY.**
Note: it's also the scariest time to buy the,. pg 88
- people shouldn't use otpions to specualte (earn money from short-term moves). pg 89
- you dn;t need to predict where the market is heading. pg 90
- There is no need to fear losing money because it will eventually happen; we already planned for this in our template. It's why we risk so little money. pg 90
