# Chapter 10: The 80/20 Wealth Building Formula

- Roughly 80% of your money is devoted to long-term buy and hold and 20% to short-term options trading.
In a $10K example account, $8K is used to buy shares of the S&P 500, and $2K is used for shorterm options trades. pg 176
- options are far too volatile. It's best to have a small portion of your net worth devoted to options trading. pg 176
- With options, we make better returns while risking less money, but it doesn't come without a price. The price is that options returns tempt you to be greedy. pg 179
