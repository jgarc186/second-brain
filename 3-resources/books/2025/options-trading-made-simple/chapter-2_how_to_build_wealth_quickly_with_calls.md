# Chapter 2: How to Build Wealth Quickly with Calls

- "Success in a free country is simple. Get a job, get an education, and learn to save and invest wisely. Anyone can do it. You can do it. I can do it. We all can do it." - William J' O'Neil pg 59
- equation looks like this:
$95 Strike Price + $5 Premium Paid = $100 (Your Breakeven)
You will recoup you investment paid for the option when the stock reaches $200 a share. Thus, exercising your rights to the call 
won't make sense unless it's trading for more than $100. However, anything above this price is profit for you. pg 65
- Ther are three different terms for descibing the strike price of an option as it relates to the stock price.
    - Out of the Money: OTM
    - At the Money: ATM
    - In the Money: ITM 
In-the-money options (ITM) have value for the owner of the option. For a call option to be ITM, the stock price has to be above the option's strike price. pg 67
- the price you pay for OTM options is comprised of "extrinsic" or time value. Since it has no real value, the markte makers put a price
on the remainig life of th eoption, which is what you will pay when you buy it. The time value can also be called a "hope" value.
You hope that before the option expires, the stock will move in the direction you need it to move in and build intrinsic value
to recoup the cost uyou paid. pg 69
