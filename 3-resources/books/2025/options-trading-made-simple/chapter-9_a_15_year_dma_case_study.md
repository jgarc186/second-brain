- "Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas." - Paul Samuelson pg 151
- the market doesn't care what we think. It's best to just trade the system and let the results do the talking.
Again, trade what you see, not what you think. pg 159

they get bored with small gains and constantly want the big gains. Let me tell you;

- patience = profits. pg 164
- small wins and losses precede the bigger victories. And this small win/loss pattern can
continue for years before you achieve significant success. pg 164
