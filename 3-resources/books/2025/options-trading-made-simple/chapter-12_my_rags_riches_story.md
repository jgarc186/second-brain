# Chapter 12: My Rags to Riches Story

- Being an options trader does me no good if I have the mindest of a poor person or a gambler. I'll just gamble with my money and will iltimately fail. pg 205
- It's incredible how well you trade when you've been humbled by failure and give up the idea of getting rich quickly. 
I even joined an options trading group for extra accountability. It felt good sharing my mistakes, especially if it precented other traders from repeating them. pg 209
