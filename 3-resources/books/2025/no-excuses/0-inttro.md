# Intro

### Notes:
- Stop using your incredible brain to think up elaborate rationalizations and justifications for not taking action.
Do something. Do anything. Get on with it! Repeat to yourself: "If it's to be, it's up to me!" - pg 3
- Losers make exuses; winners make progress. pg 3
- to achieve greatlyh, you must become a different person. It is not the material things you accomplish or acquire
that matter so much as it is the quality of the person you must become to accomplish well above the average. -pg 5
- The path of least resistance is what causes people to take the easy way i n almost every situation. They seek shortcuts to everything.
They arrive at work at the last minute and leave at the first opportunity. They look for get-rich-quick schemes an easy money. Over time,
they develop the habit of always seeking an easier, faste way to get the things they want rather than doing what is hard but necessary to achieve real success. - pg 8
- In other words, the most successful people are long-term thinkers. They look into the future as far as they can to determine the kind of people they want to become 
and the goals they want to achieve. They then come back to the preesnt and determent the things that they will have to do-ort not do-to avhieve their desired futures. - pg 9
- Successful people make sure that everything they do in the short term is consistent with where they want to end up in the long term. pg 10
- Your ability to think long term is a develop skill. As you get better at it, you become more able to predict with increasing accuracy what is likely to happen to you in the future as the result of your actions in the present. This is a quaility of the superior thinker. pg 11
- What would happen if you came home after work and, instead of eating a healthy dinner, you ate a large pieve of apple pie with ice cream. What kind of appetitie for healthy, nutritious food would you have afterward? pg 13
- would you feel tired and sluggish and ready to write off the day as largely finished? You get the same result when you go for a drink or two after work and then come home and turn on the television. These are simply different forms of "desset" that largely eliminate your ability to do anything useful for the rest of the evening. pg 13
- The habit of taking the easy way, doing what is fun and enjoyable, or eating desset before dinner becomes stronger and stronger, and it leads inevitably to personal weakness, unferachievement, and failure. pg 13
- The more you discipline yourself, the greater is your sense of sel-respect and personal pride; pg 15
