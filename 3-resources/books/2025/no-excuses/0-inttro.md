# Intro

### Notes:
- Stop using your incredible brain to think up elaborate rationalizations and justifications for not taking action.
Do something. Do anything. Get on with it! Repeat to yourself: "If it's to be, it's up to me!" - pg 3
- Losers make exuses; winners make progress. pg 3
- to achieve greatlyh, you must become a different person. It is not the material things you accomplish or acquire
that matter so much as it is the quality of the person you must become to accomplish well above the average. -pg 5
- The path of least resistance is what causes people to take the easy way i n almost every situation. They seek shortcuts to everything.
They arrive at work at the last minute and leave at the first opportunity. They look for get-rich-quick schemes an easy money. Over time,
they develop the habit of always seeking an easier, faste way to get the things they want rather than doing what is hard but necessary to achieve real success. - pg 8
- In other words, the most successful people are long-term thinkers. They look into the future as far as they can to determine the kind of people they want to become 
and the goals they want to achieve. They then come back to the preesnt and determent the things that they will have to do-ort not do-to avhieve their desired futures. - pg 9
