# Chapter 10: K-Nearest Neighbors

- the more movies you rate, the more accurately Netflix can see what other users you 're smilar to. pg 194
- You could take the average of their ratings and get 4.2 stars.
That's called regression. These are the two basic things you'll do with KNN- Classification and regression:
    - Classification = Categorization into a group
    - Regression = Predicting a response (like a number) pg 196
- There's no one right answer when it comes to picking good featuers. Youhave to think about all the differnt things you need to consider. pg 198
- How would you automatically figure out what number this is? You can use KNN for this:
    1. Go through a lot of images of numbers, and extraxt features of those numbers.
    2. When you get a new iamge, extract the features of that image, and see what its neaest engihbors are! pg 199
- The first step of OCR, where you go through images of numbers and extract features, is called training. pg 200
- Heres something that's heard to do with machine learning: really predicting whether the stock market will g up or dow. How do 
you pick goo deatures in a stock market? Suppose you say that if the stock went up yesterday, it will go up today. Is that good feature?
Or suppose you say that the stock will always go down in May. Will that work? There's no guranteed way to use [ast numbers to predict the future
performance. Predicting the future is hard, and it's almost impossible when there are so many variables involved. pg 201
