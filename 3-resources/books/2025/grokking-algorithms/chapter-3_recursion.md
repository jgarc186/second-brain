# Chapter 4: Recursion

### Notes:
- Recursion is used when it makes the solution clearer. pg 40
- Leigh Caldwell on Stack overflow: "Lops may achieve a performance gain for your program. Recursion may achieve a performance gain for your programmer. Choose which is more important in your situation!" pg 40
- When you write a recursive fucntion, you have to tell it when to stop recursing. That's why every recursive function has two parts: the base case, and the recursive case. pg 41
- when you call a function from another  fucntion, the calling function is paused in a partially completed state. All the values fo the variables for that funcition are still stored in memory. Now that you're done with the great2 function, you're back
to the greet function, and you oick up where you left off. pg 44
