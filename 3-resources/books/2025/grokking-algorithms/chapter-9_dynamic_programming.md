# Chapter 9: Dynamic Programming

- Dynamic programming starts by solving subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem. pg 163
- You combine the solutions to two subproblems to solve the bigger problem. pg 170
- Some general tips follow:
    - Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
    The values in the cells are usually what you 're tring to optmize.
    Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divic=de you problem into subproblems.
    That will help you figure out what the axes are. pg 179
- What does the grid for this problem look like? You need to answer these questions:
    - What are the values of the cells?
    - How do you divide this problem into subproblems?
    - What are the axes of the grid? pg 179
- Sometimes algorithms aren't an exact recipe. They're a framework that you build your idea on top of. pg 181
- Have you ever used diff (like git diff)? Diff tells you the differences between two files, and it uses dynamic programming to do so. pg 185
- spell-check to figuring out where a user is uploading copyright data. pg 185
- Have you ever used an app that does word wrap, like Microsoft word?
How doea it figure out where to wrap so that the line length stays consistent? Dynamic programming! pg 186
- Dynamic programming is useful when you're trying to optimize something given a constraint. pg 186
- Each cell is a subprobleml, so think about how you can dive your problem into subproblems. pg 186
