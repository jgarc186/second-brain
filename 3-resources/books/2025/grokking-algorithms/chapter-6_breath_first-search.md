# Chapter 6: Breath First Search

- The algorithm found that the shortest route to the bridge is three steps long. This type of problem is called a shortest-path problem. You're always trying to find the shorteest something.
It could be the shorteest route to your friend's house. It could be the smallest number of  moves to checkmate in a game of chess. The algorithm to solve a shortest-path problem is called breath-first search. pg 98
- Each graph is made up of nodes and edges. pg 99
- A node can be directly connected to manyu other nodes. Those nodes are called its neighbors. pg 99
- directed graph-the relationship is only one way. pg 106
- If youhave a problem like "find the shortest X," try modeling your problem as a graph, and use breath-first search to solve. pg 114
