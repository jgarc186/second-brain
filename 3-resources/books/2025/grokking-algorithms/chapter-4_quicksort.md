# Chapter 4: Quicksort

- When a good algorithmist comes across such a problem, they don't just give up. They have a toolbox full of techniques they use on the problem, trying to come up with a solution. pg 51
- divide and conquer (D&C), a well-known recursive techinque for solving problems. pg 51
- D&C gives you a new way to think about solving problems. D&C is another tool in your toolbox. When you get a new problem, you don't have to be stumped. Instead, you can ask, "Can I solve this if I use divide and conquer?" pg 52
- D&C algorithms are recurive algorithms. To solve a problem using D&C, there are two sptes:
    1. Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
    2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case. pg 53
