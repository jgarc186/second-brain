# Chapter 11: Where to Go Next


### Notes:
- Searching a sorted array takes O(log n) time in the worst case, so you might think a sorted array is better. But a binary search tree is a lot faster for insertions and deletions on avarge. pg 205
- There are special binary search trees that balance hemselves. One example is the red-black tree. pg 206
- So when are binary search trees used? B-trees, a special type of binary tree, are commonly used to store data inn databases. pg 206
- inverted index, and it's commonly used to build search engines. If you're interested in search, thisis a good place to start. pg 207
- People use the Fourier transform to try to predict upcoming eathquakes and analyze DNA. You can use it to build an app like Shazan, which guesses what song is playing. pg 207-208
- Distributed algorithms are great when you have a lot of work to do and want to speed up the time required to do it. MapReduce in particular is built up from two simple ideas: the map function and the reduce function. pg 209
- MapReduce uses these tow simple concepts to run queries about data across multiple machines. When you have a large dataset (billions of rows), MapReduce can give you an answere  in minutes where a traditional database might take hours. pg 211
- Linear programmming is a much more genral framework, and graph problems are subset of that. pg 219
