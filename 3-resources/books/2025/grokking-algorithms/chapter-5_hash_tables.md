# Chapter 5: Hash Tables

- mapping a web address to an IP address? Sounds like a perfect use case for hash tables! This process is called DNS resolution. pg 81
- hashes are good for:
    - Modeling relationships from one thing to another thing
    - Filtering out duplicates
    - Caching/memorzing data instead of making your sserver do work pg 86
