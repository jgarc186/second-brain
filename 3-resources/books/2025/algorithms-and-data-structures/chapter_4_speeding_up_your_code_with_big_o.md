# Chapter 4: Speeding Up Your Code with Big O

- If you find that Big O lavels your algortihm as a slow one, you can now take a step back and try to figure out if there’s a way to optimize it by trying to get it to fall under a fster category of big O. This may not always be possivle, of course, but it’s certainly woth thinking about. pg 47
- Bubble sort takes N2 steps, in Big O we say that bubble sort has an effiviency of O(N2). O(N2) is considered to be a relatively ineffivient algorithm. Since as the data incresaseesm the steps increase dramatically. pg 55
- Very often (but not always), when an algorithm nests one loop inside another, the algortihm is O(N2). So whenever you see a nested loop, O(N2) alarm bells should go off in your head. pg 57
