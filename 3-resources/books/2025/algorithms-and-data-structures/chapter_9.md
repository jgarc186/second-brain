# Chapter 9: Crafting Elegant Code with Stacks and Queues

- having a variaty of data structures in your programming arsenal also allows you to create code that is simplier and easier to read. pg 133
- stacks and queues are elegant tools for handling temporary data. pg 133
- Temporary data is information that doesn't have any meaning after it's processed, so you can throw it away once you're done with it. pg 133  
- A stack stores data in the same way arrays do-it's simply a list of elements. The one catch is that stacks have the following three constraints: 
    - Data can be inserted only at the end of a stack.
    - Data can be deleted only from the end of a stack.
    - Only the last element of a stack can be read.
- You can think of a stack as an actual stacks of dishes: you can't look at the face of any dish except to the top of the stack, not can you remove any dish besides the one at the top. pg 134
- most computer science literature refers to the end of the stack as its top and the beginning of the stack as its bottom. pg 134
