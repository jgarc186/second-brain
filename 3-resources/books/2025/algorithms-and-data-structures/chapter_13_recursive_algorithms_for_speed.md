# Chapter 13: Recursive Algorithms for Speed

- To partition an array is to take a random value from the array-which is then called the pivot-and make sure that every number that us less than the pivot 
ends up to the left of the pivot and that every number greater than the pivot ends up to the right of the pivot. pg 201
- Because of Quicksort's superitority in average circumstances, many programming languages use Quicksort under the hood of their built-in sorting functions.
So it's unlikely you'll be implementing Quicksort yourserlf. Hoewer, a very similar algorithm can come in handy for practical cases-and it's called Quickselect. pg 219
- Like Quicksort, Quickselect relies on partitioning and can be thought of as a hybrid of Quicksort and binary search. pg 220
