# Chapter 16: Keeping Your Priorities Straight with Heaps

- Like all data structures, each type of tree comes with its own benefits and drawbacks, and the trick is knowing which one to harness in a specific situation. pg 277
- One classic example of where a priority queue is helpful is an applocation that manages the triage system for a hospital emergency room. In the ER, we don't 
treat people strictly in the order in which theyh arrived. Instead, we treat people in the order of the severity of their symptons. If someone suddenly arrives
with a life-threatening injury, that patient will be placed at the front of the queue, even if the person with the flue had arrived hours earlier. pg 278
