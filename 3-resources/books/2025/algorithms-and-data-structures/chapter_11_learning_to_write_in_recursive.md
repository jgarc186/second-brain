# Chapter 11: Learning to Write in Recursive

### Summary:
there are various categoies of problems. Onve I learned an effective technique for a certain category, when I found another problem that belinged to the 
same category, I was able to apply the same technique to solve it.
A second area in which recursion shines is where it is agle to make a calculation based on a subproblem of the problem at hand.
recursion shines when implementing a top-down approeach because going top-down offers a new mental strategy for tackling a problem.
what is so great about top-diwn thinking: in a way, we can solve the problem without even knowing how to solve the problem.
Using recursion doesn't mean that you have to elimaite loops from your code altogether! we're 
using each tool in the way that most naturally helps is solve the problem at hand.
While recursion is a great tool for solving a variety of problems, it can actually slow your code down a lot if you're not careful.

### Notes:
- there are various categoies of problems. Onve I learned an effective technique for a certain category, when I found another problem that belinged to the 
same category, I was able to apply the same technique to solve it. pg 161
- A second area in which recursion shines is where it is agle to make a calculation based on a subproblem of the problem at hand. pg 166
- A subproblem is a version of the very same problem applied to asmaller input. pg 166
- computer science literature refers to the terms bottom-up and top-down in regard to recursion starategies. pg 167
- While we can use recursion in this way to achieve the bottom-up approach, it's not particularly elegant and doesn't add much value over using a clssic loop. pg 167
- But to go top-down, we need recursion. And because rec7ursion is the only way to achieve a top-down strategy, it's one of th ekey factors that makes recursion a poewrfgul tool. pg 168
- recursion shines when implementing a top-down approeach because going top-down offers a new mental strategy for tackling a problem. pg 168
- what is so great about top-diwn thinking: in a way, we can solve the problem without even knowing how to solve the problem. pg 168
- When we write "in recursive" to implement a top-down strategy, we get to realc our brains a little. We can even choose to ignore the details of how the calculation actually works. pg 168
- we are using a combination of loops and recursion together. Using recursion doesn't mean that you have to elimaite loops from your code altogether! we're 
using each tool in the way that most naturally helps is solve the problem at hand. pg 179
- While recursion is a great tool for solving a variety of problems, it can actually slow your code down a lot if you're not careful. pg 181
