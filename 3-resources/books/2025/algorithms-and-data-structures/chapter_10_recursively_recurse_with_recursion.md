# Chapter 10: Recursively Recurse with Recursion

- In almist any case in which youy can use a loop, you can also use Recursion. pg 150
- just because you can use recursion doesn't mean that you should use recursion. Recusion is a tool that allows for writing elegant code. pg 150
- The case in which our function will not recurse is known as the base case. pg 151
- every recursive function needs at least one base case to prevent it from calling itself indefinetly. pg 151
- The compuyter uses a stack to keep track of which functions it;s in the middle of calling. this stack is known, appropriately enough, as the call stack. pg 154
- passing a caluye up through the call stack: that is, each recursive function returns its cimputed value to uts "parent" function. Eventually, the function 
that was initially called first compoutes the final value. pg 156
- One type of problem in which recuyrsion is a natural fit is a when we need to delve into muiltuple layers of a problem without knowing how many layer there are. pg 156
