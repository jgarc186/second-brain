# Notes:
- The topic of this type of sessions isn't to repeat the sessons again and again in order to integrate.
- intergation also happens during the session, not only after.
- If something happens or not, that's part of the experience. Just because we don't feel it, it doesn't mean it 
    isn't working what is supposed to work.
- Parts works and internal family systems are very useful in this context in order to understand why we judge ourselves
during this type of sessions. Looking at which parts are doing the protection and this help us to see such parts and 
it helps us to bring wholeness of all our parts and bring better cogetion.
    - This is why parts work is crucial, seems it helps us to identify the parts that are getting activated during the
    session.
    - This could take days, weeks, months and even years to integrate, so be patient.
- Sometimes bipolart symptons can show up during the session, how do we integrate that?
    - We need to stop taking the medicine, and lets work through this and see what happened.
    - Also, this could be a sign of emergence bypolar disorder? Sometimes this could just be something that was
    induced by the medicine, that goes away after or is this something that was already there and it got triggered?
    - What other drugs where involved? What other substances were involved?
- Integrating childhood trauma.
    - Soemtimes people have memories and cematic experiences that need to be integrated.
- Having a skilledful integrator is really helpful to help us to navigate through this.
- Validating and normalizing the experience is really important. Specially if they are naive to this type of
    experiences.
- Fragmentation, is a state when lights, sounds, and other sensory expeirences are not able to be tolerated by the
    nervous system. This is a state of fragmentation, and it can be very difficult to integrate and can take sometime 
    to integrate. Month, weeks, or even years. This is why we need to help people to normalized this experiences.
    - This could happened by the doce that was taken during the experience.
    - The good side of fragmentation, is that as the part of the person get back togethre, they can give us the most
    profound insights and wisdom about ourselves.
- the integration is also learning to say "no", to say something like " I know myself, and I know that when I take taht
dose I will fragment, so I will not take that dose again".
    - The integration is learning about ourselves, and learning to say "no" to things that we know that will not
    work for us. Since we will be disentegrated in the world, which doesn't serve us to be functional in the world.
- Some people who take the medicine, the medicine doesn't help it just makes it worse, so we need to say "no" to that
person so that they don't hurt themselves. It's like weight lifting, how much weight can you take before you hurt yourself?
    - It's learning the balance of where you don't get injured, but you still get the benefits of the medicine.
    - Its hard with the medicine, bevause people want to get help. But sometimes the medicine is not the right
    medicine for them, and we need to help them to see that.
- This is why we need good friends and people who can help us to see that, because sometimes we are not able to see
    that ourselves.
- You can use the medicine as an scape, rather than dealing with the issues that you know you have to face,
like people who use antidepressants to avoid dealing with their issues. You can use any medicine to avoid dealing
    with your issues.
- Any medicine can be used to avoid dealing with your issues, so we need to be careful with that.
- The good thing about psychedelics is that they can help us to see our issues, and help us to deal with them. 
It forces us to deal with our issues, and this is why they are so powerful.
- Recreational use of psychedelics is not the same as therapeutic use, and we need to be concious of that.
- Hard experiences are not bad, and its part of the process. Let's not get surprised by them, they are part of life.
