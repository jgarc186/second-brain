# 08.31.2025 Rethinking Rest 

### Notes:
- Don't try to figure out all the details, but He gives you authotity.
- The 5 sings spiritual lack of rest:
- evasion (avoding god given responsabilitiies), issolation (you become disinterested on the needs of others), projection (is when you start forecasting
your needs unto others), exageration (when you exagerage things), and preservation.
- We keep projection rest into the future, rather than finding rest in the present moment.
- silence plus solitude, equals rests.
- solutidue isn't the same as issolation. Solitude leads to intimacy with God, issolation leads to loneliness.
- Rest ins't a place, or a destination. Rest is on the way, rest is in the middle of our seasons.
- Transitions are moments where God wants to meet us.
- We need to find those moment of transitions where God wants to meet us.
- Is in these moments where we get alone with the Lord is when we can receive His strength, is in this moments were we can uncover and transform in who 
we really are in Christ.
- God doesn't only wants to use us, He also wants to be with us.

### Scriptures:
- Mark 6: 10-12
- Mark 6: 30-35
