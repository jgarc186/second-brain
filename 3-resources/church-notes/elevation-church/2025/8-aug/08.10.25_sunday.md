# 08.10.2025 Not as Long as my Song

### Summary:
This executive summary explores the concept of human limitations and spiritual warfare through the lens of David's experiences, emphasizing that even when aligned with God's will, our human capacity has boundaries that require strategic navigation.
The teaching introduces three key principles—limits, levels, and loops—as tools for understanding when we've reached our capacity and need to elevate our approach, particularly when facing internal battles that can't be fought through physical means. 
Drawing from David's example, the message illustrates how brilliant minds often face the greatest spiritual attacks, highlighting that mental struggles aren't signs of weakness but potentially indicators of great potential under assault. 

The core strategy presented is learning to "out-sing your struggles" like David did in Psalm 13, creating something lasting and meaningful from temporary circumstances. 
Rather than remaining stuck in cycles of bringing problems to God without progression, the teaching advocates for changing levels when hitting limits to become unpredictable to spiritual enemies, emphasizing that sometimes victory comes not through divine deliverance from storms but through choosing to thrive within them. 
Ultimately, the message encourages moving beyond fear-based living to walking confidently in what God has already provided, recognizing that the mind—as the birthplace of great ideas—requires diligent protection and strategic thinking to overcome internal warfare.

### Notes:
- The human will has it limits, even when you are in the will of God.
- 3 Ls that will help us:
    - limits, levels, and loops
- When your win has no end insight, it can be impossible to see the end.
- You can come to God with your problems, but the point is not to stay there. 
- You can only be strong for so long, you can only do things for other so long.
- How long will I wrestle with my thoughts?
- David was really good at wrestling with physical things, but not with his mind.
    - What do we do when we have to fight things not in a physical location, but in the inside?
- When you hit your limit, its a sing that you need to change your level.
    - For we don't wrestle with flesh and blood, we wrestle agaisnt spritual things. 
    - When you stay still for too long, you become predictable. This is why when you hit a limit you need to change your level, so yu become impredictable to your enemy.
- It may end in failure, but I will not live in fear.
- What do you do when your mind turns on you?
    - Is is possible that the minds that are under the greatest attacks, have the greatest potential.
- David's mind wasn't a broken mind, it was a brilliant mind.
- We must guard our minds, the place of the greatest ideas is the place of the greatest battles.
- The song of David )Psalms 13) is still speaking today, not the situation that what David was enduring at the moment he wrote about it.
- Sometimes isn't about waiting on God, sometimes is about you walking on what He has already given to you.
- You need to learn from David, and out sing your struggles.
- Sometimes God doesn't deliver us from our storms, but He calls us decide in it.
