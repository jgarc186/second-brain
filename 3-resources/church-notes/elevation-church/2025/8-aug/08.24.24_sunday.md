# 08.24.2025 Sinking in the Storm, Just that Quick

### Summary:
Both fear and faith originate from our focus, meaning we can strengthen our faith by intentionally 
shifting where we direct our attention. Rather than simply enduring difficult seasons, the notes emphasize 
becoming "students of our storms" to extract wisdom that can benefit both ourselves and others. 
This process requires going beyond surface-level problems to understand the deeper "why" behind our emotional 
triggers and reactions, recognizing that genuine transformation requires both therapeutic insight and theological 
truth working together.

The notes describe a divine partnership where God uses challenges as opportunities for us to release limiting 
thoughts and receive His higher perspective, much like an "airdrop" that only works when we're close enough 
and willing to let go. This transformation happens through intentional alignment with God through prayer 
and solitude, while also building community with others who are similarly synchronized with the Lord's ways. 
The overarching message is profoundly hopeful: storms aren't merely obstacles to survive but tools God uses to 
reveal Himself, shape our character, and prepare us for purposes we can't yet see. 
Sometimes God allows us to struggle precisely so we can discover who He truly is and experience what He has 
planned on the other side of our difficulties, reminding us that we're never alone in our journey of faith and growth.

### Notes:
- Fear comes from focus, so does faith.
- Change your focus and you can increase your faith.
- When you go through storms, we need to become students of it. So we can become wise and teach it to others.
- Jesus don't only saves our spirits, but He also help us to transform our minds.
- We refuse Jesus as Lord, but we cling to Him as a savior. John McArthur
- When Jesus gives a command, you can obey it with condifence, you don't have to make a calculation to obey it.
- We need to go deeper than our problems, we need to ask "Why?". When we get trigger, you need to understand
why are you getting trigger for it?
- It's not a matter of getting trigger, it's a matter of catching the reason why you are getting trigger.
- The Truth can keep you out of the trap of patterns.
- We need both therapy and theology to bring real change into our lives.
- Why does God allow challenges into our lives?
    - Challenges gives us an opportunitty to let go of thoughts and ideas that we hold near in our heads.
    - If we don't drop the thought, we will drawn or sink in the sea of our problems.
    - God also drop a thought into our minds.
    - Just because I think it, it doesn't mean we have to be it.
    - God will show you the higher way, so drop your thoughts so God can drop his thoughts to You. Just like an airdrop,
    if we are close enough we can get new thoughts from God.
        - The moment we drop our limiting thought, that's the moment He catches us.
- We need to get alone with God, to get align with God.
    - Pray and seek God's ways.
    - I am sinking because I'm not seating with God?
    - You have no idea what is God is going to do for you on the other side of your storm.
    - We need to sync our thoughts with God thoughts while we are in the storm.
    - Sometimes God allows us to struggle for a bit, in order to know who God is.
        - By becoming students of our storms, we can see who God is in our lives.
- We need to get other people in our boat that are in sync with the Lord:
    - We need to stop doing it our way, and do it His ways.
    - You are not alone in your boat.
    - We need to synchronize with others that are in sync with Lord.
- Maybe the storm, is being used by God to form you into what He has plan for you.
