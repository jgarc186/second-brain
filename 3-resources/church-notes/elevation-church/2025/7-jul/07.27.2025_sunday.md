### Summary:
We often undervalue our thoughts because we live in a world that prioritizes material things over what happens in our minds.
While we would never carry a dirty sneaker into important places, we freely carry dirty thoughts everywhere we go.
Many times, we also fail to value God’s thoughts, even though a single God-given thought is profoundly valuable.
God’s thoughts are vast and expansive, yet we often pass them by, distracted by things like scrolling through social media.
When God gives us a word, do we take the time to sit with it and meditate on it? We don’t have to wait passively for God to speak; we can actively go to His Word.
God speaks through impressions, instructions, and interruptions.

Impressions can be subjective, while instructions are clear and rooted in Scripture.
Do we approach God’s Word so that it shapes us and His thoughts dwell in us? Instead of asking for things, we should ask God for a thought, a word, a scripture, a verse, or even a book.
The same God who brings peace also controls chaos, and we cannot fix chaos by simply discarding physical things; we must remove whatever does not bring Jesus into our lives.
Call on God before crisis hits—before you end up “in the belly of the fish.” Our problems often stem from our thoughts, so rather than regretting actions, we should examine the thinking behind them.
Our thoughts are costly and powerful, capable of leading us to happiness, prosperity, peace, joy, and love when aligned with God’s truth.

### Notes:
- We under value our thoughts, because we life in a world that values things more than thoughts.
    - We wouldn't take a dirty sneaker to places, but we dare to take our dirty thoughts to everywhere we go.
- There are times were we don't value God's thoughts.
    - A God thought is valuable.
- How valuable is a God thought to you?
    - We can pass by the God thoughts when we scroll through our social media.
- God's thoughts are expansive, they are bast.
- When He gives you a word, would you seat for it for a minute and meditate on it?
- We don't have to wait for the word of the Lord to come to you, you can go to the word of the Lord.
- God speaks through:
    - Impressions.
        - The problems with impressions is that they can be subjective.
    - Instructions.
        - Instructions are objective and clear in the word of God.
    - Interruptions.
        - 
- Do we come to the word of the Lord so that the Word of the Lord can come to us?        
- We need to ask God to give us a thought, a word, a scripture, a verse, a chapter, a book. Not a thing.
- The God of the peace is the God of the chaos, He controls both parts of our lives.
- You can't fix chaos, by throwing stuff away. You need to throw away those things that are not bringing Jesus into your boat.
- Call on your God, before you get in the belly of the fish.
    - You don't have to go to hell to call on God, you can call on God when you are making decisions.
    - Your problems are the manifestations of the thoughts, rather than saying I wish I didn't do that, ask yourself "What was my thinking when I did that?"
- My thoughts cost too much, my thoughts can lead to happiness, prosperity, peace, joy, and love.
- Sometimes isn't about the storm that you are going through, is the thoughts that you are having in the storm.
- Maybe if God hasn't done it the way you wanted, is because He knows how things are going to end up.
