# 07.20.2025 That's What I Thought

### Summary:
Most life problems stem from internal misalignment with divine guidance
rather than external sources or others' actions. This often involves getting trapped
by one's own thoughts and unrealistic expectations about
identity or position in life, which can lead to distress when unmet. The
key is learning from mistakes without self-condemnation; failing to do so
prevents personal growth. 

Recognizing error in the present moment, not just
retrospectively, is challenging but crucial for breaking free from
self-imposed limitations. While feeling distressed during difficult times
is normal and acceptable due to imperfection (as Jesus forgives us), it's vital to distinguish
this temporary discomfort from pervasive despair caused by negative thinking patterns like the "Three
P's" â€“ viewing struggles as personal failures that affect everything permanently, which can trap
individuals in ruts. 

By shifting focus to God's power rather than one's own perceived limitations or frustrations 
("we become powerless," but focusing on God makes us "powerful"), believers avoid letting distress morph 
into despair and find the strength needed for growth and progress through faith, also using biblical examples to reshape one's thinking.

### Notes:
- 90% of my problems doesn't come from others or the enemy, but me don't doing what God has told me to do.
    - Is getting trap in what I thought. 
    - It's not who I am as a person, but what I thought I should be and where I should be now.
    - It's our expectations that are not met that tricks us into thinking that we are not where we should be.
- Have you ever been at a place where you thought you where right, but you were completely wrong?
- Jesus forgave us our sins and mistakes, but He doesn't want us to forget about the lessons we can learned from our dumb decisioins.
- If we don't take time to learn from our mistakes, and take lessons from them, then we are not going to grow in our lives.
    - When we learned that we can be wrong, and growing from it, then we can be free from the expectations that we have put on ourselves.
- The hardest part is recognizing when we are wrong at the present moment, not in hindsight.
- What do you do when you think the problem is God, what He did is so much different than what you thought He would do?
    - We are allowed to feel angry, sad, and disappointed. The Bible doesn't say that we can't feel those things.
- The 3 P's of negative thinking:
    1. Personal: You take it personally, like it's your fault.
    2. Pervasive: You think it affects everything in your life.
    3. Permanent: You think it will never change.
    - When we fall into the trap of the 3 P's, we are going to get stuck in a rut.
    - By falling into the trap of the 3 P's, you are not going to make progress in that area of your life.
- Distress is part of the human experience, God never promissed us that we would never have distress in our lives.
    - We are allowed to feel the distress, but don't fall into the trap of dispair (which is the 3 P's).
- You are tougher than you look.
- Never allow distress to become despair (which becomes a trap).
- When we focus on our power, we become powerless. When we focus on God's power, we become powerful.
    - We have remember that the battle doesn't belong to us, but to the Lord.
- Reshape your thinking using the word of God, don't focus on the present. It's only in retrospect that the red sea looks like a blessing.
    - The attack, problems, and difficulties, are the signs that our future is bright.
    - We need to ask ourselves "What is God trying to teach me?" and "What is it that God wants me to grow in?"
    - Think things through the mind of Daniel, think it through the mind of David, think it through the mind of Joseph.
        - Use Bible characters as examples of how to think through things.
- we are one thought away from peace, one thought away from joy.
