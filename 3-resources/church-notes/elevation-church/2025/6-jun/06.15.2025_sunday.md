# 06.15.2025 - I don't Know

### Summary:
True confidence doesn’t come from what we know, but from trusting God, especially in times of uncertainty.
Relying on knowledge alone leads to insecurity, while faith invites us to move forward without having all the answers.
Faith is not about having perfect clarity but about where we go with our doubts and questions.
Often, our misguided questions stem from flawed beliefs or experiences that shape an incorrect view of God.
Instead of asking “Why is this happening?”, we should ask, “What is God teaching me through this?” Obedience requires us to take the next step even without seeing the full path, walking in faith based on God’s word.
Knowledge must be joined with experience for a fuller understanding, but true transformation comes through a personal encounter with God.
While we study the Word to learn, it’s through living it that we truly know its power.
We can be blinded by our need for certainty, forgetting that spiritual knowledge—revealed by the Spirit of God—surpasses both intellectual and experiential learning.
Ultimately, we must ask ourselves: Do we just want to know about God, or do we truly want to know Him?
