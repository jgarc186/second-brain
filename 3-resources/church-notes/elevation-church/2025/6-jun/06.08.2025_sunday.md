# 06.08.2025 - God Choose Me

### Summary:
These church notes emphasize the profound power of our inner dialogue and confessions—especially the silent ones we repeat to ourselves daily. Our beliefs and self-talk are often rooted in childhood experiences, shaping our present reality without us even realizing it. Sometimes, we internalize voices from the past and mistake them for our own. The message challenges us to examine how we speak to ourselves—asking if we’d tolerate others speaking that way to our children. It reminds us that even believers can forget God’s transformative work in their lives. Our confidence shouldn’t come from people or possessions, but from the truth that God chose us with purpose. Difficult times are necessary, revealing what we're made of and reminding us that mistakes don’t disqualify us. Believing that God chose you equips you to face challenges, live boldly with Christ within you, and remain humble and grateful for your place in God’s plan.

### Notes:
- There are consessions that you make every day, you will alwasys reap the effects of your confessions.
- The most powerful confessions are the ones that you speak in your head.
- Confessions are rooted based on your father or mother, or somewhere else in your childhood.
- Our believes and confessions are affecting out present reality.
- Sometimes we don't remember who it was, and we start to believe that it was us.
- How are we talking to ourselves? If we were to record our thoughts, would we like the way we talk to ourselves?
Is this the way that would you allow anyone else to talk to your children?
- There is a part of you that believes in you and another part that doesn't.
- The worst part of been a believer is forgetting about where God took us from. We forget how God power and transformation in our lives.
- Our source of confidence is not in our material possessions, but it needs to be found in the fact that God choose us and He put is in here.
- Stop waiting for your family members to validate you, stop waiting for your boss to say go, God choose you, and He put you in here for a reason.
- You are not here by accident, you were not born into your family by accident, you are here because God choose you.
- We need to go through difficult and hard times, because we need to see what's inside of us, we need to see what we are made of.
- God is going to show you what are you made of, and He is using this difficult times to show you what you are made of.
- Just because you made a mistake, you are not disqualified.
- Three things that you need to believe if God choose you:
    1. It keep you ready for any of the challenges that you are going to face.
    2. The next thing that helps us this mindset, is that it keeps us ridiculously.
        - The same power that raised Jesus from the dead, is the same power that is inside of us. We need to decide that if Jesus is inside of us, or not.
        - So I'm going to live like Jesus is inside of me, and I'm going to live as the embassador of Christ that I'm called to be.
        - You don't have to be afraid of the world, you have a source of peace and power that is inside of you.
    3. It keeps you reverent:
        - Reverent means that you are going to be humble, and you are going to be grateful for the opportunity that you have to be here.
        - WE are reverent about our anscertors and our past.
