# 06.22.2025 - The weapons are in the house

- you don't get to choose whom god will use, he is going to use whomever he wants.
- God deserves the right to use people you don't like.
- God will use your enemies to help you to produce more fruit inside of you than a friend ever could.
- its funny how we judge people whom battles you don't have to fight.
- You can be faithful and still take a little step.
- are you so obsees with what you don;t have that you have forgotten what you do have?
- Every moment of power, is preceeded by countless hours of practice.

### Scripture:
- Judges 4: 14-18
