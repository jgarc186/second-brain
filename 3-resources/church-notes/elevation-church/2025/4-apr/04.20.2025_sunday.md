# 04.20.2025 - This May Be My God Moment

### Summary:
These notes emphasize the importance of
learning and growing through experiences,
including pain and doubt. They highlight
the value of faith in uncertain times,
encouraging us to "show up" and trust in
God's transformation on His timeline,
rather than our own expectations.

The notes also remind us that God is present
even in darkness, and that He calls us
based on His character and intentions,
not our perceived shortcomings or
disfunctions. Ultimately, the notes
invite us to find faith and identity in
the midst of uncertainty, trusting that
God's power and love are at work, even
when we don't fully understand.

### Notes:
- Sometimes we don;t learn through words, but through hurts.
- The better move is to learn from the pain of others.
- Faith is found, not when we have it. Faith is found in the middle of the doubt.
- Showing up is the first step to faith.
- God transforms people on His timeline, not ours.
- People will call you based on your disfunction, but God will call you based on what
He has put in you.
- The darkest moments reveals the depeast truths about who God is.
- Even when we don't know why, He is still our God.
