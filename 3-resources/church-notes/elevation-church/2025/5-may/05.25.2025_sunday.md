# 05.25.2025 - Allow Joy to Reintroduce Himself

### Notes:
- Your happiness matters to God.
- How we view the scriptures, is how we view God, and how we view God is how we interprect our circumstances.
- It's not about going out into the world to find joy, it is found within us.
- Our joy follows from the character of Jesus that flows from our heart.
- The first word that comes out of Jesus mounth is "blessed".
- We have expectations connected to certain locations or milestones in our lives.
- The question isn't "what's next", the question is "what's present?".
- The heart of joy isn't in the glamorous, but in the mundane.
- You will find joy in the present, not in the future.
- 7 characteristic of happiness:
  1. Creation happiness.
  2. fitness haniness.
  3. Friendship happiness.
  4. Work happiness.
  5. spiritual happiness.
  6. Intellectual happiness.
  7. Emotional happiness.
- Jesus was revealing himself in the sermon on the mount.
- God cried, why do you think that you always have to be happy?
- God doesn't want you to burry your feelings, He wants you to process them.
    - When you cry during praise and worship, this is a process of healing.
- There is only one door way into the joy of the Lord and that is Jesus himself.
- It's a greater blessing to love by God, rather than to serve Him.

### Scripture:
- Matthew 5: 1-10
- Genesis 1: 28
