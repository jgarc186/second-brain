# Embracing Program's Success Principles

## The itaratioin process:
- Learning how to learn is one of the most valuable skills we can learn in life.

### Process vs Principles:
- You must understand the principles first in order to do the processes which give you the outcome.
- principles are:
    - Delivebarete practice
    - visualization
    - principle of the frameworks
- itaratioin is growth, and growth is itaratioin.
- How do you get good at a skill?
    - you first create a hypothesis about how to get better.
    - Once you practice the hypothesis you will find an antithesis (problems) about your hypothesis.
    - Once you find a problem you need to pick up a book, hired a coach, attend a seminar, ask questions, get out of your own personal bubble.
        - this leads you to improve your hypothesis.
    - Once you create a hypothesis 2, you will create an antithesis 2 (problems) and you seek help again.
    - you repeat this process again and again, this leads to grow.
    - if you stop itaratioin, you will stop growing.
- We need to iterate over our understanding of our principles and over the processes that we are doing.
- In other for us to be able to grow faster is by finding antithesis (problems), so we can search for answers so we can go to the process of success faster.
